# Abstract

The satsconverter repository on GitHub (Originally created by [bitkarrot](https://github.com/bitkarrot)) is built using Python and HTML, CSS, Javascript that converts Bitcoin amounts between satoshis and BTC units. The satoshi is the smallest unit of Bitcoin, representing one hundred millionth of a single Bitcoin (0.00000001 BTC).

I am one of the contributors of this project on [Github](https://github.com/bitkarrot/satsconverter/graphs/contributors).

This is currently a running website (https://rates.bitcoin.org.hk/)
