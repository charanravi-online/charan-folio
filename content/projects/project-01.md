# Abstract

The Terminal-Wiki project on GitHub is a command-line tool for accessing and searching Wikipedia articles directly from the terminal. The project allows users to retrieve summary information on a topic or query, as well as access full articles in a text-based format.

The project is written in Python and uses the Wikipedia API to retrieve and process data. It also utilizes the Pygments library to add syntax highlighting to the text output, making it easier to read and follow.

Overall, the Terminal-Wiki project provides a useful and efficient way for users to access information from Wikipedia without leaving their terminal, which could be helpful for researchers or anyone who prefers a command-line interface over a traditional web browser.
